# In this sample, code between 'do' and 'done' runs several times.
# How much ones? We use a variable named 'i' that changes on each iteration.
# This variable...
# - has a value of 'zero' before we start (that means 'i = 0' after the 'for')
# - changes adding one on each loop (that's what 'i ++' stands for)
# An "exit loop condition" is fortunately defined...
# - when 'i' becomes greater than 10, the loop ends 
#   and execution continues below the 'done' clause
